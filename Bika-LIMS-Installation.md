### Introduction
This document details the installation steps for Bika LIMS version 3.1 from the Plone Unified Installer package for Linux, as well as the setup for Apache as web proxy to make the LIMS available on the standard http port 80. The process should be similar for MacOSX and other Unix-type operating systems. The **gcc compiler**, **python**, the **python-dev library** and **git** are all required,  you may use those already installed on your operating system. Basic skills with GNU/Linux terminal are required.

***
### Step-by-step Installation

#### 1. Creating your Bika LIMS root directory
Create the directory where you want to place your LIMS instance and call it 'bika'. In this recipe, we'll place bika inside a /home/user directory, but ask to your system admin about the best place in your case.
```bash
$ cd /home/user
$ mkdir bika
```
#### 2. Installing required system packages
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install gcc zlib1g-dev libssl-dev gnuplot git-core
```
Bika LIMS uses the [WeasyPrint](http://weasyprint.org) module for pdf creation, so some other packages will be needed. For Debian 7.0 Wheezy or newer, Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric or newer:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libcairo2 libpango1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0
```

For WeasyPrint depencies on other OSes, check the full list here: http://weasyprint.org/docs/install/

#### 3. Installing Plone 4.3.2

```bash
$ wget -nc http://launchpad.net/plone/4.3/4.3.2/+download/Plone-4.3.2-UnifiedInstaller.tgz
```

Untar the archive and run the installer:

```bash
$ tar xzf Plone-4.3.2-UnifiedInstaller.tgz
$ cd Plone-4.3.2-UnifiedInstaller/
$ ./install.sh --build-python --static-lxml=yes --target=../bika standalone
```

This takes a while and some warnings might appear, omit them. Verify successful build from the output of the installer script. Refer to [Plone's installation documentation](http://plone.org/documentation/topic/Installation) if installation fails:

    ######################  Installation Complete  ######################

    for startup instructions

    The account has full 'Manager' privileges.

#### 4. Downloading Bika LIMS

```bash
$ cd ../bika/zinstance
$ git clone -b release/3.1 http://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS.git src/bika.lims
```

In this recipe, the Bika LIMS 3.1 release is used, which is the preferred version for production environments. Change ```release/3.1``` to ```develop``` if you want to use the latest Bika LIMS at your own risk. Refer to [git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) for further information about how to update the source code or change to another branch from the repository. 

#### 5. Edit the buildout.cfg
Open the ``buildout.cfg`` (in ``bika/zinstance dir``):

```bash
$ nano buildout.cfg
```

  a) Find the ``eggs`` section.  Add ``bika.lims`` and ``WeasyPrint``:

       eggs =
           Plone
           Pillow
           bika.lims
           WeasyPrint

   b) Find the ``develop`` section. Add ``src/bika.lims``:

       develop =
           src/bika.lims
   
   c) Find the ``versions`` section. Add ``WeasyPrint = 0.19.2``

       [versions]
       WeasyPrint = 0.19.2

   c) (Optional) Change the Zope instance port if the default 8080 is not used::

       http-address = 8080

   d) (Optional) Change the ``effective-user`` if ``plone`` is not the one used. 

   e) (Optional) Add the environment-vars entry for the ID-server for multiple-client
       installations, noting port number::

       [instance]
       environment-vars =
           IDServerURL http://localhost:8081


#### 6. Execute the buildout
Do the (verbose, if needed) buildout of the instance::

```bash
$ bin/buildout -v
```

This takes a while and some warnings might appear. Verify successful build from the output of the installer script. Refer to [Plone's installation documentation](http://plone.org/documentation/topic/Installation) if installation fails:
```

*************** /PICKED VERSIONS ***************
```

#### 7. Get the admin's password
If the buildout finished successfully, an 'adminPassword.txt' have been created automatically inside zinstance directory. That file contains the super-user credentials you'll need to create the Bika site.
```bash
$ cat adminPassword.txt
```

#### 8. Test run in foreground, noting error messages if any and taking corrective action if so:
```bash
$ bin/plonectl fg
...
2011-11-13 12:06:07 INFO Zope Ready to handle requests
```

#### 9. Add the Plone instance with Bika LIMS extension
Open a browser and type http://localhost:8080/

Set 'Plone' as identifier and ensure that the Bika LIMS option is ticked.
If your server has no GUI installed, you can use a terminal line browser like ``lynx``:
```bash
$ lynx http://localhost:8080/
```

#### 10. Start working with Bika LIMS
```bash
$ bin/plonectl start
```
Open a browser and go to your Bika LIMS instance: http://localhost:8080/Plone

***
### Extras
#### Using apache to redirect http requests to Bika LIMS
Set up a domain name for the LIMS site URL and add the Apache mapping noting the Zope server port used by the instance (default 8080).
Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/blob/3.01a/docs/APACHE.md

#### Update the Bika source code from the GitHub repository
Rename (or move) the src/bika.lims directory or rerun the ``git clone`` or ``git pull`` or switch branches on the command line in the source directory src/bika.lims, then re-run bin/buildout.

#### Start with a completely fresh instance::
Rename/move the Data.fs.* files in var/filestorage (after stopping instance).
