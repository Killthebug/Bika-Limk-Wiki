***

### Summary

Bika LIMS has some lab forms running on Android for labs without enough desk space for bigger hardware. There is also demand for a standalone app to use in remote sampling locations, e.g. health care, which can then be synced with on-line servers when the app gets in range. 

It should capture sampling point / patient details, take photos and GPS coordinates, and record results for field analyses.

With this in mind, the following are the modules to be implemented:

- Data capture
- Server sync
- More on-line functionality

**Expected results**: A functional app to capture remote data and sync it with Bika servers. More on-line functionality 

**Skills required**: Android SDK, HTML, [Python](http://python.org), [Plone](http://plone.org), [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com), CSS. Familiarity with Bika LIMS is a plus.

**Skill level**: High

**Mentors**: [J. Puiggené](http://github.com/xispa), [C. McKellar-Basset](http://github.com/rockfruit)
