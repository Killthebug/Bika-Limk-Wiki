### Can Bika LIMS be installed in Windows?
**Yes**. Although we recommend installing Bika LIMS in a GNU/Linux machine, **Bika LIMS can be installed in Windows** too. Since Bika LIMS is a web-based application, this question only refers to the web-server; once installed, only a modern web navigator is needed in workstations.

Plone recently stopped building the Unified Installer for Windows in favour of a VirtualBox/Vagrant setup.
Unless someone is really interested in integrating Bika into the Windows ways of doing things (i.e. server
roles, IIS config, whatever), Bika LIMS can be installed in a single well-maintained Virtual Machine.

Get help in users/developer lists for Windows-specific questions could be harder because most of the developers behind the scenes use GNU/Linux instead of Windows
