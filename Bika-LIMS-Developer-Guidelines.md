### Introduction

Because Bika LIMS is a collaborative project, adhering to consistent development rules, code formatting, and naming conventions is especially important. Please review the guidelines for information about best practices.

Software development conventions are important in a multi-developer project, and help developers read and understand each other's code. Please try to follow the guidelines described here. Your cooperation will improve the effectiveness of the collaboration.

If you haven't done yet, please review the information about the community channels available and how to ask for help at the [Community](https://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/wiki/Community) page.

### Releases life-cycle

Bika LIMS project developers are committed with [release early, release often (RERO)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) philosophy in order to get more feedback from the users community and thus increase the quality of the system, both from technically and functional standpoints. Please read [Releases life-cycle](https://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/wiki/Releases-life-cycle) to know how it works and pay special attention to section [Releases and Branches](https://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/wiki/Releases-life-cycle#releases-and-branches) from the same document.

### Branches and Branch-per-feature (BPF) approach

Bika LIMS software development is based on Branch-per-feature approach. Before going further, please take your time to read thoroughly the [*A successful Git branching model, Vincent Driessen, 2010*](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [*Branch-per-feature post, Adam Dimirtuk's, 2012*](http://dymitruk.com/blog/2012/02/05/branch-per-feature/) and [*A pragmatic guide to the Branch Per Feature git branching strategy, Katherine Bailey, 2013*](https://www.acquia.com/blog/pragmatic-guide-branch-feature-git-branching-strategy) posts.

**TO BE COMPLETED**

#### hotfix/next branch

Only bug fixes and very small enhancements are allowed to hotfix/next branch. This branch is only used for updates (minor releases) and is regularly merged to develop. If you want to fix a bug, create a fork from hotfix/next and fix the bug there. When finished, you can do a pull request to bikalabs' hotfix/next, including the JIRA's ID issue number, a deescription of the fix and the full log obtained after running the bika.lims Robot Tests. Remember also to update the CHANGELOG.txt. 

If all goes well, the Bika LIMS source code maintainers will merge your pull request into hotfix/next.

#### develop branch

The develop branch is the base branch for new features and enhancements. In consequence, all branch-per-features should be created from develop.

### Best practices

Adapted from *[Kepler's project development guide](https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference/software-development-guidelines)*

1. Try not to hinder other developers
    - Make sure code compiles and passes all tests before committing it. 
    - Try to minimize the impact to other developers. Use branch-per-features approach.

2. Commits should be neat, portable and documented:
    - Indent the code using spaces instead of tabs, 4 spaces per tab.
    - Try to use 80-characters per line at maximum
    - Use appropriate, descriptive names for classes and variables
    - Comment the classes, methods and whatever. Better to be in excess than in lack.
    - Remove extraneous code that is not used

3. Communicate with other developers
    - Use the IRC channel and dev lists
    - Commit frequently, in small and logically related patches with good log messages

In addition, try to follow the [PEP-8 Style guide for Python Code](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) in general.

We also recommend that people write short, to-the-point methods that encapsulate a very specific behavior, rather than long procedural functions. If your methods are longer that 30-40 lines of code, or if they have extensive conditional blocks or switch statements, they might be broken up into several methods. But this is very subjective. Related to this is the importance of factoring out common procedures into their own classes or methods; if you find yourself writing the same type of functionality multiple times, it's definitely time to refactor.
