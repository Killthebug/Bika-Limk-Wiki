### How-tos, Tips and Examples

#### Import/Export tools

- ##### [Creating an instrument import interface](https://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/wiki/creating-an-instrument-import-interface)

   The introduction of analyses results into Bika LIMS can be performed manually, but also automatically by using the results files generated directly by equipment or middleware software. 

- ##### [Using JSON to connect with Bika-LIMS](https://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/wiki/BIKA-JSON-API)

   Bika includes plone.jsonapi for reading, updating, and creating and deleting objects. The JSON API is used internally for many AJAX requests, and also for implementing alternative interface.


#### Customization of report templates

- ##### Modifying the results report
