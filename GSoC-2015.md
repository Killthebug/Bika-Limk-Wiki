## Introduction

<img alt="Google Summer of Code 2015" align="right" src="http://naralabs.com/images/gsoc2015.jpg">
Bika LIMS is an industry proven, [ISO/IEC 17025](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_17025) compliant [Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_information_management_system) that leverages the power and technical simplicity of [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) and the versatiliy and safety provided by [Plone](https://plone.org/). It is a robust LIMS that can be adapted and implemented in any laboratory, from those of small size to large research and clinic laboratories.

Bika LIMS can be also extended easily by using the Plone's add-on mechanisms. Some of the extensions already available are [Bika Health LIS](http://github.com/bikalabs/bika-health) (for health care laboratories) and [Graphite Theme](http://github.com/naralabs/graphite.theme) (a theme focused on improving usability and user experience).

At present there are 85 members subscribed to the [Bika developers mailing list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/bika-developers), 350 to the [user list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/bika-users), 45 LIMS [designers and analysts](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/bika-design) and 65 participants on a [list dedicated to a Bika Health LIS add-on](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/bika-health). With established market traction and profile and a strong user and developer community, Bika OS LIMS will continue to grow and maintain its position as the world's leading Open Source LIMS.

This year, **Bika Open Source LIMS is serving as a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code 2015 program (GSoC 2015)](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015)**, a global program that offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. 


## Instructions for Students

Students wishing to participate will be required to produce code for Bika OS LIMS in 3 months, but don't have to be a proven developer. However, experience in python and Plone is welcome.

Google defines a student as an individual enrolled in or accepted into an accredited institution including (but not necessarily limited to) colleges, universities, masters programs, PhD programs and undergraduate programs. You should be prepared, upon request, to provide Google with transcripts or other documentation from your accredited institution as proof of enrollment or admission status. You may be enrolled as a full-time or part-time student, and must be 18 years of age to be eligible to participate in Google Summer of Code 2015. Please, visit [GSoC's Student Guide](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/) and pay special attention to the **Eligibility** section of the [GSoC's FAQs](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page).

### Adding a proposal

If you are an eligible and interested student,

1. Take a look at the [list of ideas below](#ideas-list)
2. Come up with project that you're interested in
3. Write a first draft proposal following the [guidelines](#student-proposal-guidelines)
4. Submit your proposal using the [GsoC 2015 website](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015)

**The application form will be open from February 20 until March 16**. We recommend you to submit your application early. By doing so, it will be given a greater share of attention than is possible for applications submitted at the last minute. 

### Student proposal guidelines

As a general recommendation, write a clear proposal on what you plan to do, what your project is and what it is not. Bika OS LIMS project doesn't require a specific format or specific list of information, but here are some specific points that you should address in your application:

* Who are you? What are you studying? 
* Do you have experience as an Open Source developer already? On what? Where?
* From the [list of ideas below](#ideas-list), which project are you interested in?
* Why you would like to execute in this particular project?
* How many hours are you going to work on this a week? 20 (part-time)? 40 (full-time)?
* Contact information

You can also adapt the proposal if:

* You think the project as suggested is too large and you can only feasibly complete part of it.

   In this case, make sure your proposal covers a reasonable subset of the functionality (that is, something which is useful without the rest of the project being implemented).

* You think the project as suggested is too small.

    In this case you might want to extend the idea, combine projects, etc.

* You like the basic idea of the project but it is not such a good fit for the skills that you have.

    In this case, please feel free to suggest an alternative, but try to remember that the idea is for the software to be useful for its existing and potential users.


## Ideas list

We list, in no particular order, some proposals for projects to be carried out by the students participating in GsoC 2015. This is by no means a closed list, so the students can feel free to propose an alternative activities related to the project:

### ID01. Productivity, management and tracking reports
**Description**

One of the most requested functionalities. Bika LIMS already covers most of the functionalities required in a laboratory workflow, but still lacks in the generation of reports regarding to the current state of the system, the analyses done during a period of time, daily-usage reporting or tracking charts amongst others. The main objectives are:

- Rebuild the reporting machinery to be more flexible, easy-to-use and easy-to-extend. Must be enough flexible to allow the incorporation of new report templates by only creating few rules, a template file and occasionally, some bits of JS and/or CSS.
- Embed a generic querying tool to be used for as many reports as possible: filters by client, between a period of time, by states, grouping, etc.
- Port the reports already available to the new machinery and improve some of them with charts and better styling.

**Expected results**: Something resembling the vision outlined above

**Skills required**: Plone, Zope, python, Zope Page Templates (TAL+TALES+METAL), jQuery, D3.js, CSS (for graphs). Familiarity with Bika LIMS is a plus.

**Skill level**: medium to high

**Mentor(s)**: [J.Puiggené](http://github.com/xispa), [M. Campbell-Basset](http://github.com/rockfruit)

### ID02. Inventory management module
**Description**

This is an entirely new module for Bika LIMS, that might be better implemented as a Plone add-on. While Bika LIMS already has the basics for Product and Sample References management, as well as some initial functionalities related with Supply Orders, this sub-system has been omitted for too much time. The basics are:

- Supplier orders (from lab to suppliers)
- Supplier orders reception and products location on reception. Labelling
- Boxes and packages mechanisms to add sub-products to the inventory
- Stock control for reagents and products (including sample references): min/max alerts and imbalance adjustment (1th a month, etc.)
- Keep control of batches of product and allow to remove all products from the same batch (i.e. defective batches)
- Keep control of expiry dates (alerts and product auto-removal)
- Semi-automated stock control mechanism when reagents or products are used in tests
- Inventory reports. Current status. In a period of time

**Expected results**: Something resembling the vision outlined above

**Skills required**: python, Plone, jQuery. Familiariy with Bika LIMS is a plus.

**Skill level**: medium to high

**Mentor(s)**: [J.Puiggené](http://github.com/xispa), [M. Campbell-Basset](http://github.com/rockfruit)

### ID03. Bika Health LIS FDA's 21 CFR Part 11 Compliant
**Description**

Bika Health LIS is a Plone add-on that adds CLIA compatible health care functionality to Bika LIMS ISO 17025 ready Micro-Biology and Chemistry. Patients, Doctors, Referring Institutes, Clinical Cases, interfaces with clinical instruments and EMR or hospital systems. It is also used in veterinary settings with animal subjects and veterinarians in these roles. Bika Health is not yet full  compliant with FDA's 21 CFR Part 11. Some tweaks of code and the development of additional features such as the following are required:

- Electronic signatures need to employ two distinct components
- At least one electronic signature component to be re-applied during a series of signings
- Generate accurate and complete copies of records in both human readable and electronic form suitable for inspection and review
- Audit Trail Logger subsystem: record user's IP, timestamp, source_status, transitions, description. Audit Trail Log screen in every record. Audit Trail report of any record, including the user's basic information and electronic signature. Audit Trail reports templates and filtering.

**Expected results**: Something resembling the vision outlined above

**Skills required**: python, electronic signatures, Plone, jQuery. Familiarity with Bika LIMS and Bika Health is a plus.

**Skill level**: medium to high

**Mentor(s)**: [J.Puiggené](http://github.com/xispa), [M. Campbell-Basset](http://github.com/rockfruit)

### ID04. SQL-enable Bika LIMS

**Description**

Bika LIMS, uses ZoDB as the default Database Management System. Although Bika LIMS already provides a JSON-API interface for integrate the system with other systems (mainly ERPs), 
Bika LIMS uses ZODB, a very powerful object-oriented database, but has nothing to do with SQL. Bika LIMS can connect and exchange data with other systems (like ERPs) by using its JSON API. Nevertheless, most systems use relational databases (PostgreSQL and MySQL mainly) and we are aware that many labs would find Bika LIMS more easy to connect with other systems if it had support for SQL-like databases. That could be done by using RelStorage or/and SQLAlchemy.

**Expected results**: Bika LIMS with full SQL support for PostgreSQL

**Skills required**: python, Plone, RelStorage, SQLAlchemy, SQL. Familiarity with Bika LIMS is a plus.

**Skill level**: high

**Mentor(s)**: [J.Puiggené](http://github.com/xispa), [M. Campbell-Basset](http://github.com/rockfruit)

### ID05. EduLIMS add-on for Bika LIMS

**Description**

A Bika LIMS add-on specifically oriented to educational centers, whether private or public, such as schools, colleges, universities and technology centers. EduLIMS is meant to be an add-on focused on trainees activity tracking and evaluation. The ieda is to train students in the use of a LIMS by using the LIMS itself and, at the same time, learn the basics of a lab workflow (including methods, QA/QC, instrument management, etc.). With this in mind, the following are the modules to be implemented:

- Training environment: training sessions and guided training use-cases.
- Trainees activity tracking and evaluation
- Scoring module

**Expected results**: Something resembling the vision outlined above

**Skills required**: python, Plone, jQuery, CSS. Familiarity with Bika LIMS is a plus.

**Skill level**: high

**Mentor(s)**: [J.Puiggené](http://github.com/xispa), [M. Campbell-Basset](http://github.com/rockfruit)
