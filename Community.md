### Community help

The members of the Bika project help everybody who needs assistance, through the Project distribution lists, the [issue tracker](http://github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/issues) or directly through the [IRC Channel](irc://freenode/bika). Everybody is welcome but you have to consider that the help provided is coming from other community members who are volunteering their time and effort to try to help you:

* Before looking for assistance on a particular problem first consult and check information in the documentation and/or issue tracker and attempt to resolve the problem yourself if possible.
* If you use a distribution list, please use an understandable and appropriate title in the subject message.
* Provide the maximum amount of details as possible. If you use the IRC we recommend using services like 'pastebin' instead of pasting up all the text provided for the debug trace.
* In order to avoid misunderstandings, please communicate in a polite and clear manner.
